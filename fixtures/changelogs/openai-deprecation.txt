## Deprecation of text-davinci-003 and other legacy models

We are announcing the deprecation of the following models:

- `text-davinci-003`
- `text-davinci-002`
- `code-davinci-002`

These models will be removed on January 4, 2024. After this date, API calls
using these models will return an error.

### Recommended migration path

- For text generation: migrate to `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4`
- For code generation: migrate to `gpt-4` with system prompts optimized for code
- For embeddings: migrate to `text-embedding-ada-002`

### Timeline

- **Now**: Models are deprecated. New fine-tunes using these models are no longer accepted.
- **January 4, 2024**: Models will be shut down. All API calls will fail.

Please update your integrations before the sunset date.
